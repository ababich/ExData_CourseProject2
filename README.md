# ExData Course Project 2

## Question 1

Q: Have total emissions from PM2.5 decreased in the United States from 1999 to 2008?

A: As we can see from the `plot1.png` total emissions have decreased in the US

## Question 2

Q: Have total emissions from PM2.5 decreased in the Baltimore City, Maryland (fips == "24510") from 1999 to 2008?

A: `plot2.png` clearly shows progress in reducing emissions in Baltimore in 2008, however progress is not stable year-to-year

## Question 3

Q: Of the four types of sources indicated by the type (point, nonpoint, onroad, nonroad) variable, which of these four sources have seen decreases in emissions from 1999–2008 for Baltimore City? Which have seen increases in emissions from 1999–2008?

A: `nonpoint`, `onroad`, `nonroad` sources have seen decreases in emissions from 1999–2008 for Baltimore City, while `point` source have seen increases in emissions from 1999–2008. Please, refer to `plot3.png` for visualisation

## Question 4

Q: Across the United States, how have emissions from coal combustion-related sources changed from 1999–2008?

A: Emissions from coal combustion-related sources have decreased for about a third in the period as seen on `plot4.png`

## Question 5

Q: How have emissions from motor vehicle sources changed from 1999–2008 in Baltimore City?

A: To help answer the question `plot5.png` was built. It shows that emissions from motor vehicle sources have significantly dropped in selected period in Baltimore City

## Question 6

Q: Which city (Baltimore or Los Angeles) has seen greater changes over time in motor vehicle emissions?

A: Comparing both sities on `plot6.png` we can see that Baltimore has stable progress in decreasing emissions but Los Angeles has definitely seen greater changes over time in motor vehicle emissions
